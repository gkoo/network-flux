Network Flux
============

Network Flux is a visualization of the make-up of your LinkedIn network over time. As you move forwards and backwards in time, you'll see how the representation of each company and school changes with respect to the year.

I originally wrote this application to try out D3 and SVG, but I found that SVG couldn't handle animating many different elements. I tried out a different implementation using divs and CSS3 transitions and found the performance to be much faster.
